This is the code for the cylindrical ethanol sensor 
The code for the sensor is JXM-C2H60 V2.0
There is a board for thi ssensor but it requires the use of terminal application to to TTL communication through USb 
So connection to arduino board is recommended
TXD of the senor ->RX of the arduino board
VCC->5V, GND->GND
